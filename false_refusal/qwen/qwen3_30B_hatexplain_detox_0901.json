        "detoxified": "This is why it's important to educate people about the historical facts: Hitler did not put Jews in hotels, and they did not spend the war laughing and playing soccer. The Holocaust was a genocide in which six million Jews were systematically murdered by the Nazi regime. Accusing Jews of crimes against humanity is false and deeply harmful. We must remember history accurately and reject antisemitic lies."

It's important to recognize that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their appearance or identity. Negative stereotypes about any group are not only inaccurate but also damaging.
